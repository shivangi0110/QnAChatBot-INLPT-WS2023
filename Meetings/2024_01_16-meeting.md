Participants: All (online)

We discussed the topics we want to work on now:

- Janik: Work on better chunking. Add file numberation. Handle Footnotes
- Shivangi: setup vector database. Add metadata to the entries.
- Suryansh: setup a LLM, naive approach: concatenated context + query as an input.
- Shreeharsh:  Hypothetical Questions. Evalutaion of the vector database with it.

Things we want to do later:
- Filter before search by temporal or file filter.
- better approch to give context + query to LLM (maybe advanced propting) ...
- Create Simple chat ui
