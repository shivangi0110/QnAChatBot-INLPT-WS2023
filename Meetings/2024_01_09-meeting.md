Participants: All (online)

We dicussed the current project progress. 

- Janik first showed his progess with the data aquisition and chunking. We exploit the structure of the html documents and want to enrich each text chunk with the data about the chapter/annex, article and number/character identifier they belong to.
- Suryansh further worked on exploring the LLAMA2 model for the transformer component later.
- Shivangi showed again how to use the faiss database. The plan is now to get it running with the text chunks we have.
- Shreeharsh is still learning with the material form the tutorials.

On Thursday we have a meeting scheduled with the mentor. Directly before it, we want to meet again such that everybody is on the same page with the project status.
