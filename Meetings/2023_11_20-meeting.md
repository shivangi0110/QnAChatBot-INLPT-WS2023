Participants: All (in place)

Discuss the datasets possible:

Arguments:
- PubMed is easier to get the data per API (just need the strings in the abstracts), EUR-Lex needs conversion from pdf or html to string data
- Words used in EUR-Lex database may be easier to deal with because they are used more frequently then medical terms
- legal acts is supposedly more strict and clear then medical science there different people prefer different treatments and theories

Decision: EUR-Lex database
